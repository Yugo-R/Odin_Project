# Library-App
This project is a library app. You can add books that you read and add some description.

Some goals for this project
- Make it responsive
- Add a folder feature so that you can categorize your books (NOT FINISHED WILL COME BACK LATER TO ADD THIS FEATURE)
- Use data base storage, local(localStorage) or online(Firebase) (maybe both)
