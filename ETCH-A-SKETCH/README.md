# ETCH-A-SKETCH
In this project I'll be creating a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch a Sketch.

Some objectives for the project:
- Use css grid for the container grid.
- Able to change the grid size from 4 up to 64 grids.
- Customisable color. 
- Draw from a preset color ie: rainbow.
